At least 4 billion "useless eaters" shall be eliminated by the year 2050 by
means of limited wars, organized epidemics of fatal rapid-acting diseases
and starvation. Energy, food and water shall be kept at subsistence levels
for the non-elite, starting with the white populations of Western Europe and
North America and then spreading to other races. The populations of Canada,
Western Europe and the United States will be decimated more rapidly than on
other continents, until the world's population reaches a manageable level of
1 billion, of which 500 million will consist of Chinese and Japanese races,
selected because they are people who have been regimented for centuries and
who are accustomed to obeying authority without question.
